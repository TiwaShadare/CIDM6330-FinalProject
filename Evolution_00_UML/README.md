# Assignment: Domain Selection  
## Problem  
Quite a number of recent college graduates and candidates are tired of endlessly searching for a job. They send out hundreds of applications monthly without receiving a single interview invite. At the same time, recruiters are also struggling to find qualified candidates for the open roles they have in their organization. A recruitment software that links recruiters to the right candidate and streamline the employment process will solve this problem.  
A Recruitment System - A system that links qualified candidates to job opportunities that suit their particular skillset and experience. It equally links recruiters to the right candidates.  
## Domain  
The proposed softwareâ€™s domain will be a Recruitment /Employment domain, which will help streamline the employment process for both the candidate and the recruiter/employer.  
## Personal/Professional interest in problem domain  
This will be a software that helps a candidate find the right job. Candidates can search by location, job title, and more. They can also search by skills, experience, salary range and so much more. It will be an application where talents meet opportunities. We will help recruiters find the right candidates for their jobs and at the same time help candidates, such as new graduates, find the right job offer.  

**Current problem:** Recruiters are currently struggling to find qualified candidates due to fragmented data silos and a disjointed hiring process. For recruiters, the recruitment software will streamline the hiring process, by helping recruiters manage the entire hiring process in one place, from creating new job openings, scheduling interviews, and evaluating candidates with custom scorecards to sending offer letters.  

Currently, most candidates are frustrated with the job search process, which is often a lengthy and drawn-out process that involves a slew of rejections and leaves them with little room for negotiation about your remuneration package. They also struggle to find jobs that suit their skill set, education, and experience. Our software matches them with the vacancies and adds them to the short list of candidates sent to the employer (with their permission). All the candidate has to do is consider the vacancy and, if interested, prepare for an interview that will be automatically scheduled by the software.  
## Prototype  
The prototype will be similar to Indeed or ZipRecruiter but with a more streamlined process. I have created a quick process flow to depict what the process will look like in the proposed software.
